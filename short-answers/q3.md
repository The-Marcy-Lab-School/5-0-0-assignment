# Question
Look at these two examples:

```js
// example 1
const multiplyNumberByX = (nums, x) => {
  return nums.map(num => num * x);
}
```

```js
const repeatWordNumTimes = (word, num) => {
  console.log(word.repeat(num));
}
```

Which of the two examples above uses a closure? Specifically, which part?
